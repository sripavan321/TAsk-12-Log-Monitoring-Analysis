# TAsk-12-Log-Monitoring-Analysis
This task focuses on collecting, reviewing, and analyzing system and network logs to detect suspicious activities, security incidents, and policy violations.

1. Log Collection

System, application, and network logs were gathered from various sources such as servers, firewalls, and endpoints. Centralized logging tools were used to aggregate data for easier monitoring.

Objective: Ensure all relevant events are recorded for security analysis.

2. Log Analysis

Logs were examined to identify unusual patterns, failed login attempts, unauthorized access, and abnormal traffic behavior. Filtering and correlation techniques were applied to detect potential threats.

Objective: Detect early signs of security incidents.

3. Threat Detection & Alerting

Automated alerts were configured to trigger when predefined thresholds or suspicious activities were detected (e.g., multiple failed logins, privilege escalation attempts).

Objective: Enable real-time response to potential security threats.

4. Reporting & Incident Response

Findings were documented, categorized based on severity, and escalated according to incident response procedures. Reports help improve future security posture and compliance requirements.

Objective: Maintain accountability and continuous security improvement.
